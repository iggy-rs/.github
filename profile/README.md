Welcome to [Iggy.rs](https://iggy.rs) message streaming!

We've recently joined the Apache Incubator and we'll start transitioning all the repositories to the [apache/iggy](https://github.com/apache/iggy),

Join our [Discord](https://iggy.rs/discord) server to get in touch with the community and ask any questions you might have.

For the **quick start tutorial** on how to run the streaming server, etc. check the [main readme](https://github.com/iggy-rs/iggy/blob/master/README.md).

To find out how to **build your first application** using the SDK, please refer to the [getting started](https://docs.iggy.rs/introduction/getting-started) guide.

If you'd like to **contribute** to the project, please check the [contributing](https://github.com/iggy-rs/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide.
